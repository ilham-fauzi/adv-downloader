## Overview

ADV Downloader is a macOS application built with SwiftUI. It wraps [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) in a simple, guided interface: paste a link (or search), pick a quality, and download. Power users can switch to **Advanced** mode to control formats, post-processing, subtitles, networking and the exact command line.

Two additions set it apart from a plain `yt-dlp` front end:

- **A private network path.** Route the downloader and the built-in browser through an SSH tunnel to a server you control, without changing the rest of your Mac's network.
- **An experimental in-app browser** with ad blocking, per-site muting and direct file downloads.

## Features

**Downloading**
- Paste a link and pick from a simplified quality list (video up to 2160p, audio 320/256/192/128 kbps) with a recommended option highlighted.
- Automatic analysis when a link is pasted, with estimated file sizes.
- Download queue with progress, speed and ETA, pause/resume/cancel/retry, 1–5 simultaneous downloads, and persistence across launches.
- Clipboard suggestion ("Use the link from your clipboard?"), completion toast and optional macOS notifications.
- Plain-language error messages instead of raw `yt-dlp` output.
- Menu bar companion for quick downloads.

**Finding videos**
- Type a search phrase, or paste a YouTube channel, playlist or search link, to get a browsable grid of videos. Click one to choose its quality.
- Paginated loading ("Load more") with thumbnails, duration, channel and view counts.

**Advanced mode**
- Tabs for Format, Post-Processing, Subtitles, Network, Filesystem and Advanced options.
- Live command-line preview, presets, and a log console.

**VPN (SSH tunnel)**
- One-switch tunnel through your own SSH server, used only by this app.
- Key-based or password login; secrets are stored in the macOS Keychain.
- Fail-closed behaviour: while the VPN switch is on but not connected, nothing is sent over your normal network.

**Browser (Beta)**
- Browse any website inside the app; send video pages to the downloader with one click.
- Direct file downloads (zip, pdf, media files and other attachments).
- Ad and tracker blocking powered by EasyList and EasyPrivacy, plus YouTube-specific handling.
- Site muting with a "mute everything by default" mode.
- One-click clear (blank page, cookies and site data).

**Desktop polish**
- Light, dark and system appearance.
- Window limited between the app's normal size and the visible desktop; double-click the title bar to fill the desktop and again to restore.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Operating system | macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later |
| Build toolchain | Xcode with Swift 6 |
| [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) | Required (the app can guide installation) |
| [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) | Required for merging and audio extraction |
| VPN feature | An SSH server you control, with TCP forwarding enabled |

Install the tools with Homebrew if you prefer:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

## Getting started

### Run from source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Y-Downloader
./scripts/run-app.sh
```

The script builds the project, assembles `ADV Downloader.app` in `.build/`, signs it ad hoc and launches it. Running it as a real `.app` bundle matters: keyboard shortcuts, notifications and the Dock icon only work properly that way.

On first launch the **Setup Assistant** checks for `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` and helps you install what is missing. You can also set custom paths under **Settings → Binaries**.

### Build with Xcode

The repository ships with an Xcode project generated from [`project.yml`](project.yml) ([XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)). To regenerate it after changing the spec:

```bash
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
```

## Using the app

### Downloader

1. Paste a video link into the box (or type a search phrase). Analysis starts automatically.
2. Choose **Video** or **Audio only**, then click **Download** on the quality you want.
3. Follow progress in the Downloads panel. When finished, open the file or its folder from the toast or the panel.

Switch between **Simple** and **Advanced** with the toggle in the toolbar (⇧⌘M). Keyboard shortcuts: **⌘D** start a download, **⇧⌘A** analyze, **⇧⌘V** paste a URL.

### Browsing lists of videos

Anything that is not a single video link opens a list instead:

| You enter | Result |
|---|---|
| `swift tutorial` | Search results |
| `youtube.com/@channel` | The channel's videos (or `/shorts`, `/streams`, `/playlists`) |
| `youtube.com/playlist?list=…` | The playlist's videos |
| `youtube.com/results?search_query=…` | Search results |

Click any card to open the quality picker; use **Back to list** to return without reloading. In Advanced mode the list appears under the link box.

> The YouTube home page and personalised recommendations require a signed-in account and cannot be listed this way. Use the [Browser](#browser-beta) tab to browse them.

### VPN through your own server

The VPN feature runs `ssh -D` as a child process, creating a local SOCKS5 proxy that exits through your server. Only this app's traffic uses it.

**Server requirements:** SSH access, and `AllowTcpForwarding yes` in `sshd_config` (the default on most systems).

**Setup**

1. Open **Settings → VPN** (or **Settings → Set up…** in Simple mode).
2. Enter the server address, SSH port and username.
3. Choose a login method:
   - **SSH Key** — paste the full private key (`-----BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END …-----`), plus its passphrase if it has one.
   - **Password** — enter your SSH password.
4. Click **Test connection**. On first use you are asked to confirm the server's fingerprint.
5. Turn on **Connect by VPN** from the **VPN** button in the toolbar.

**Behaviour**

- Analysis, downloads and the built-in browser use `socks5h://127.0.0.1:<port>` (default port 1080), so DNS is resolved by the server too.
- When connected, the app shows the exit IP address of your server.
- If the tunnel drops, the app retries up to three times. While the switch is on and the tunnel is down, requests fail with a clear message instead of leaking onto your normal network.
- Private keys, passphrases and passwords are stored in the Keychain. A key is written to a temporary file (mode `600`) only while connecting and is deleted as soon as login completes.
- Host keys are pinned in the app's own `known_hosts`. If a server's fingerprint changes, the connection is refused until you choose **Forget server**.

### Browser (Beta)

Select **Browser (Beta)** in the toolbar segmented control. The browser starts on a blank page.

| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Address bar | Enter a URL or a search phrase (searches use DuckDuckGo) |
| Shield | Turn ad and tracker blocking on or off |
| Speaker | Mute or unmute the current site; the arrow opens "Mute all sites by default" |
| ✕ | Clear the browser: blank page, cookies, cache and site data |
| Download button | **Download video** (video pages), **Show as list** (channels, playlists, searches) or **Try to download** (other sites) |

Direct file links (attachments, archives and other non-displayable content) download straight into your download folder, with progress shown under the page.

**Ad blocking**

The app downloads [EasyList](https://easylist.to) and [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt) on first use, converts them to WebKit content-blocker rules and refreshes them weekly. A small built-in rule set and a YouTube-specific script (which removes ad data from player responses) are applied on top. Hover over the shield to see the filter status.

**Muting**

Every site starts muted by default. Click the speaker to unmute a site; the choice is remembered per site.

The browser is experimental. It is gated by **Settings → General → Experimental: Browser tab** and can be hidden.

## Settings and data locations

| Item | Location |
|---|---|
| Default download folder | `~/Downloads/Y-Downloader` (change in Settings) |
| App data (`yt-dlp` binary, queue, presets, ad filter lists, pinned SSH host keys) | `~/Library/Application Support/Y-Downloader/` |
| VPN secrets (key, passphrase, password) | macOS Keychain, service `com.ydownloader.vpn` |
| Preferences | `UserDefaults` (`com.ydownloader.Y-Downloader`) |
| Browser cookies and site data | `~/Library/WebKit/com.ydownloader.Y-Downloader` |

## Privacy and security

- **No telemetry.** The app contains no analytics or tracking of its own.
- **Network activity** is limited to: the sites you download from or browse, the `yt-dlp` updater (if enabled), the ad filter lists on `easylist.to`, and — when the VPN is connected — a request to `api.ipify.org` through the tunnel to display your exit IP.
- The filter-list download does not go through the VPN tunnel.
- The VPN is only as private as the server you point it at; your server operator can see the traffic that exits through it.
- The app is not sandboxed (it runs user-installed binaries). Review the entitlements in [`Y-Downloader.entitlements`](Y-Downloader/Resources/Y-Downloader.entitlements) before distributing.
- The site-mute feature calls an internal WebKit selector (`_setPageMuted:`). It is looked up at runtime and the button disables itself if it is unavailable. Replace it with a public mechanism before any App Store submission.

```

### Build and test

```bash
swift build
swift test --filter VPNTests
swift test --filter ListingTests
swift test --filter BrowserTests
```

Run a subset with `--filter`; some suites touch the network. The live suite needs the real `yt-dlp` and an internet connection:

```bash
LIVE=1 swift test --filter LiveTests
```

The EasyList conversion test is skipped unless you point it at a local copy of the list:

```bash
YDL_EASYLIST=/path/to/easylist.txt swift test --filter testEasyListConvertsAndCompiles
```

### Regenerating the app icon

```bash
swift scripts/make-icon.swift      # draws design/AppIcon-1024.png
./scripts/build-icon.sh            # builds Y-Downloader/Resources/AppIcon.icns
```

### Dependencies

| Package | Use |
|---|---|
| [AdguardTeam/SafariConverterLib](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/SafariConverterLib) | Converts EasyList/EasyPrivacy rules to WebKit content-blocker JSON |
| [gumob/PunycodeSwift](https://github.com/gumob/PunycodeSwift), [ameshkov/swift-psl](https://github.com/ameshkov/swift-psl) | Transitive dependencies of the converter |

> SwiftPM resource bundles (for example `swift-psl_PublicSuffixList.bundle`) must be present inside the application bundle at `Contents/Resources`. `scripts/run-app.sh` copies them automatically; do the same in any custom packaging step, or the app will crash at launch when it first converts the filter lists.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to try |
|---|---|
| "yt-dlp binary not found" | Run the Setup Assistant, or set the path in **Settings → Binaries** |
| Merging or audio extraction fails | Install `ffmpeg` (`brew install ffmpeg`) and set its path in **Settings → Binaries** |
| VPN: "Login failed" | Check the username and the key or password. If the key has a passphrase, enter it too |
| VPN: "The server's identity changed" | Only continue if you reinstalled the server, then use **Forget server** |
| VPN: connected but traffic does not pass | The server may disable TCP forwarding (`AllowTcpForwarding`) |
| Downloads fail with "VPN is turned on but not connected" | Reconnect the VPN or turn the switch off |
| A site breaks in the browser | Turn the shield off for that session; some sites do not tolerate content blocking |
| Ads still appear in the browser | The built-in blocking is rule-based and cannot match every ad. Hover over the shield to confirm the filter lists are active |
| App crashes at launch after a custom build | Make sure the `.bundle` resource folders were copied into `Contents/Resources` |

## Known limitations

- List browsing recognises YouTube channels, playlists and searches. Other sites are treated as single-video links.
- The YouTube home feed cannot be listed without a signed-in session.
- Ad blocking uses WebKit content-blocker rules; it is not as thorough as a full browser-level blocker, and YouTube may change its player at any time.
- The in-app browser is experimental: no tabs, bookmarks or history, and no extension support.
- DRM-protected streams cannot be downloaded.
- macOS only.
